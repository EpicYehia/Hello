    <p>My name is Yehia, I'm on Github, I was born in Cairo,  Egypt, where I still live to this day in Rehab. I'm raised by my loving parents, and I'm an only child. I was in a school called Lycee el 7oreya when I was 4 and 5 years old, but I moved when I was 6 to a school called Ecole de L'avenir, where I made a lot of friends and I'm still in the school to this day. My passions are gaming and programming, which I both love. On this website, you will learn a lot about me.</p></div>
